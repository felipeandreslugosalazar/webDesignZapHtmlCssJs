Portfolio - Web design project // HTML, CSS and JS
WORK IN PROGRESS...

This project is a Web Design exercise intending to show what am I able to create with HTML, CSS, and JS.

Taking as an example an existing website, I have coded the HTML, the CSS, and the JavaScript as if a designer
would have sent me an image of a website to implement.

All the code has been written by me, the design concept and the images belong to "zap.dylanon.com".
